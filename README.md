# Introduction
You're viewing the new and updated version of React Native Starter, previous version can be found under the v1 branch

A powerful react native starter template that bootstraps development of your mobile application. React Native Starter is a mobile application template with lots of built-in components like sidebar, navigation, form elements, etc - all you need to start building your mobile app faster. Check out live demo on App Store, Google Play.

## primary technologies:
1) react

2) react-native

3) react-navigation

4) redux

5) eslint

6) i18n

Application structured in a way, which we find most efficient in both short and long term projects. The main intention of the current structure is to keep logical components close to each other and define clear structure for the common things, such as navigation, store, api wrappers, reducers, action creators, store selectors

2. 
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mithun1508/nativescript-react 

# Navigate to clonned folder and Install dependencies
cd nativescript-react && yarn install

# Install Pods
cd ios && pod install
2. Open RNS in your iOS simulator
Run this command to start the development server and to start your app on iOS simulator:

yarn run:ios

Or, if you prefer Android:


yarn run:android
## That's it! Cool, right?

2) https://docs.nativescript.org/introduction.html


## Example real-world app
See the Apps showcase in the docs to see various apps built with React NativeScript.

One example is my rpstrackerrns issue-tracking example app, which demonstrates how you can make fully native, professional-looking UIs with RNS:

## Features		
1) Login Page

2) Backlog Page

3) Detail Page

## Plugins
Although NativeScript lets you write native code inline as JavaScript, you can also write modules purely using native code (e.g. Objective-C and Java), and access the code directly in NativeScript via JavaScript. When a common, cross-platform JavaScript API is provided for such modules, it is called a "plugin", and can be thought of as equivalent to a React Native "native module". NativeScript has a rich ecosystem of these plugins â€“ see the NativeScript Marketplace.

React NativeScript uses the same plugins API as NativeScript Vue and NativeScript Angular, so all those plugins should be compatible (although generally needing to be consumed with any type, as most plugins are only typed for NativeScript Core). Instructions on how to integrate plugins, and provide typings for React, can be found in the React NativeScript plugins documentation.

## Why not just use React Native?

# Is it production-ready?

It's based on React, NativeScript Core, and NativeScript Vue, which are each individually production-ready. Make of that what you will.
